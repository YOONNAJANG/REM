### Setting Environment
We trained the models under the setting of `python==3.7` and `torch==1.5.0`,  with one RTX8000 GPU. Also, our codes are built on the codes of [huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai), and we utilized [pytorch-ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite) from pytorch in [`ignite`](https://github.com/pkchat-focus/FoCus/tree/main/ignite) folder.

1.Make a virtual environment
    
    $conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.7

2.Install `pytorch==1.5.0`

    $conda install pytorch==1.5.0 torchvision==0.6.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

3.Install the required libraries.
    
    $pip install -r requirements.txt
    


### Dataset 
This data is the modified version of the original data (which is reported in the paper) after ethical inspection.

You should create directories named **`infer_log_focus`, `train_log_focus`, `test_log_focus`, `models`, `data`** under FoCus folder.

We put train, valid, test files of the dataset in the **`data`** folder. 

The project directory should follow this directory structure:


    ðŸ“¦REM
    â”£ ðŸ“‚data
    â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œtrain.json
    â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œvalid.json
    â”£ ðŸ“‚metrics
    â”£ ðŸ“‚src
    â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
    â”— ðŸ“œrequirements.txt


### Training models
Uncomment the command lines in the **`train.sh`** file, to start training the model. 

    $ sh train.sh 


### Evaluation
Uncomment the command lines in the **`test.sh`** file, to evaluate the model on the test set. 

    $ sh test.sh


### Inference
Uncomment the command lines in the **`inference.sh`** file, to generate utterances with the trained models.

    $ sh inference.sh
